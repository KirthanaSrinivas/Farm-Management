# Farm-Management
FARM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM successfully implemented based on online selling which
helps us in administrating the agro-products user for managing the tasks performed by
farmers. The project successfully used various functionalities of Xampp and Python Flask and
also created a fully functional database management system for online portals.
Using MySQL as the database is highly beneficial as it is free to download, popular, and can
be easily customized. The data stored in the MySQL database can easily be retrieved and
manipulated according to the requirements with basic knowledge of SQL.
